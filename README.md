🎯 **About Me**  
I’m a Python developer with 2 years of experience in machine learning, API development, and microservice-based architectures. I have hands-on experience applying ML techniques to real-world projects like extracting structured data from financial documents. I’ve worked extensively with PostgreSQL and MSSQL, creating robust data migration scripts, optimizing queries, and managing database workflows. I’m passionate about developing scalable, intelligent systems that automate processes and deliver practical business impact.

📌 **Featured Projects**

- 🧾 **Invoice & Bank Document Data Extraction (Private / Work Project)**  
Developed machine learning models using Linear Regression and SVM with TF-IDF vectorization to accurately extract key fields from financial documents. Managed end-to-end workflows including data collection, cleaning, training, and model tuning, which improved extraction accuracy from 50% to 75%. Deployed the final model as a microservice for efficient and scalable integration.

- 🔄 **Database Migration & Automation Scripts (Private / Work Project)**  
  Designed and implemented a robust Python + SQLAlchemy migration utility that takes a job name as input, loads job configuration, and migrates entire tables accordingly.  
  Developed scripts to enable data transfer between two versions of an application using PostgreSQL and MSSQL.  
  Built an automated script to create databases with a defined schema directly from UI input.  
  Worked extensively on writing **triggers**, **functions**, **views**, and optimizing **SQL queries** for performance across PostgreSQL and MSSQL.
-  🤖 [**Smart Resume Parser + Job Recommender**](https://github.com/vyshnavi-kunapareddy-026/smart_resume_parser_job_recommender)
  Built a full-stack system using **FastAPI** that parses resumes (PDF/DOCX), extracts relevant fields using NER models and custom regex, and recommends jobs using real-time job APIs like **Adzuna**/**JobSpy**.  
    - ✅ Integrated **spaCy** & **HuggingFace Transformers** for name, education, and experience extraction  
    - 📄 Used **PyMuPDF** for layout-based resume sectioning  
    - 🧠 Matched skills with a weighted skill list to recommend roles  
    - 🌐 Supports **live job recommendations** through external APIs with filters
