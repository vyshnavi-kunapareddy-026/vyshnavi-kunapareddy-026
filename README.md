üéØ **About Me**  
I‚Äôm a Python developer with 2 years of experience specializing in machine learning, API development, and microservice-based architectures.  
I have hands-on experience applying ML techniques such as **linear regression**, **SVM**, and **TF-IDF vectorizers** to extract and analyze data from financial documents like invoices and bank statements.  
In addition, I‚Äôve worked extensively with databases including **MSSQL** and **PostgreSQL**, developing efficient scripts for data migration and management.  
I‚Äôm passionate about building intelligent, scalable solutions that automate workflows and solve real-world business problems.

üìå **Featured Projects**

- üßæ **Invoice & Bank Document Data Extraction (Private / Work Project)**  
Developed machine learning models using Linear Regression and SVM with TF-IDF vectorization to accurately extract key fields from financial documents. Managed end-to-end workflows including data collection, cleaning, training, and model tuning, which improved extraction accuracy from 50% to 75%. Deployed the final model as a microservice for efficient and scalable integration.

- üîÑ **Database Migration & Automation Scripts (Private / Work Project)**  
  Designed and implemented a robust Python + SQLAlchemy migration utility that takes a job name as input, loads job configuration, and migrates entire tables accordingly.  
  Developed scripts to enable data transfer between two versions of an application using PostgreSQL and MSSQL.  
  Built an automated script to create databases with a defined schema directly from UI input.  
  Worked extensively on writing **triggers**, **functions**, **views**, and optimizing **SQL queries** for performance across PostgreSQL and MSSQL.
